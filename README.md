Here is a README for a basic notes app built with React and Django.

# React Django Notes App

A simple and efficient note-taking application built with a React frontend and a Django backend. This application allows users to create, view, edit, and delete notes seamlessly.

-----

## üöÄ Features

  * **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)** operations for notes.
  * **Modern User Interface** built with React.
  * **Powerful Backend** powered by Django & Django REST Framework.
  * **RESTful API** for smooth communication between the frontend and backend.
  * **Simple and Intuitive** to use.

-----

## üíª Tech Stack

  * **Frontend:** React.js
  * **Backend:** Django, Django REST Framework
  * **Database:** SQLite3 (default, configurable)

-----

\#\#üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

  * [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.8 or newer)
  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (14.x or newer) and npm/yarn

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

### 1\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-django-notes-app.git
cd react-django-notes-app
```

### 2\. Backend Setup (Django)

Navigate to the `backend` directory and set up the Django application.

```bash
cd backend

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Apply database migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Run the backend server
python manage.py runserver
```

The Django development server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 3\. Frontend Setup (React)

Open a new terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory, and set up the React application.

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the React development server
npm start
```

The React development server will start on `http://localhost:3000` and will proxy API requests to your Django backend.

-----

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Once both the backend and frontend servers are running:

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
2.  You should see the notes application interface.
3.  Start creating, viewing, updating, and deleting your notes\!

-----

## üìù API Endpoints

The backend exposes the following API endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GET` | `/api/notes/` | Retrieve a list of all notes. |
| `GET` | `/api/notes/<id>/` | Retrieve a single note by its ID. |
| `POST`| `/api/notes/` | Create a new note. |
