Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js and npm (LTS version recommended)

Python 3.8+ and pip

Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to get your development environment set up.

Backend (Django)
Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-django-notes-app.git
cd react-django-notes-app/backend

Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:

On macOS/Linux:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

On Windows:

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Apply Database Migrations:

python manage.py migrate

Create a Superuser (Optional):
This allows you to access the Django admin panel.

python manage.py createsuperuser

Frontend (React)
Navigate to the Frontend Directory:
Open a new terminal window and navigate to the frontend directory.

cd react-django-notes-app/frontend

Install Dependencies:

npm install

Environment Variables (Optional):
The React app will try to connect to the Django API at http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/. If your backend is running on a different address, you can create a .env file in the frontend directory and set the API URL:

REACT_APP_API_URL=http://your-backend-url/api

Running the Application
Start the Backend Server:
In your terminal with the backend directory and virtual environment active, run:

python manage.py runserver

The Django API will be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

Start the Frontend Server:
In your other terminal with the frontend directory, run:

npm start

The React application will open in your browser at http://localhost:3000/.
